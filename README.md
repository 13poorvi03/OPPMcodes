# OOPM 🚀  

This repository is created to serve as my dedicated space for learning and practicing Object-Oriented Programming Methodology (OOPM) in C++. It is not just a random collection of code, but a carefully organized set of examples that cover all the major concepts of object-oriented programming. The main purpose behind building this repo is to strengthen my knowledge, prepare thoroughly for exams, and ensure that I have a reliable reference whenever I need to revise important topics. Each program is written with clarity, proper comments, and step-by-step explanations so that it can be easily understood during quick revisions or while preparing under time pressure.  

The repo will include concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, destructors, inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, friend functions, templates, and exception handling. These topics form the backbone of C++ and mastering them is essential not only for exams but also for becoming a strong programmer. By keeping the code simple yet complete, I aim to make this repository exam-friendly while also ensuring that it can grow into a professional resource in the future.  

Currently, the focus is on building a solid foundation for academic success, but later I plan to expand this repository into a working reference for real-world projects. That means the same concepts I am practicing now will eventually be applied to practical scenarios, helping me transition from student-level exercises to professional-level implementations. This repo is like my personal notebook, but in digital form, where every piece of code is stored safely and can be reused or improved whenever needed.  

In short, OOPM is my journey of learning C++ step by step, documenting everything in one place, and preparing myself both for exams and for future opportunities. It is a mix of study material, practice ground, and long-term knowledge base. I hope this collection will not only help me but also anyone else who wants to quickly revise or understand C++ OOPM concepts in a clean and structured way.
